# Voice Agent with Stateful Execution and Tool Integration

This prototype enables building intelligent voice agents that maintain context while supporting function execution in response to caller requests. By simultaneously sending audio input with contextual state information to OpenAI's Realtime API, the system receives both audio responses for the caller and structured data for backend systems.

## Key Capabilities

- **Dual-Channel Communication**: Send audio with state metadata; receive audio responses with action commands
- **Stateful Conversations**: Track conversation progress, identified entities, and verification status
- **Seamless Tool Integration**: Execute functions like identity verification or card replacement without disrupting conversation flow
- **No Transcription Dependencies**: Pure audio input/output with state management, eliminating transcription overhead

## Use Case: Banking Voice Assistant

This approach enables building voice agents for financial services where callers can request services like replacing a bank card while the system automatically:

1. Tracks conversation context across turns
2. Determines when to execute identity verification
3. Checks account eligibility via backend tools
4. Processes the card replacement request
5. Provides confirmation details

All while maintaining natural conversation flow without exposing implementation details to the caller.

This architecture dramatically simplifies the development of voice agents that require both human-like conversation and sophisticated backend integration, creating more efficient and natural customer service experiences.
